\chapter{Abstract}
Accurate throughput prediction is an important component of many of today's communication systems such as video streaming or the scheduling of large downloads. Today's world heavily utilizes wireless communication technologies such as 4G and 5G for such applications, however throughput prediction for wireless systems presents a unique challenge for application designers due to the highly dynamic nature of wireless networks. Deep learning based throughput prediction models have previously been recognised as a good approach to tackling this problem due to the high dimensionality and complexity of cellular data. This project aims to expand on these previous works by creating a multi-stage deep learning model. The goal of the multi-stage model is to better accommodate for the imbalanced nature of cellular data and improve upon the deep learning model's ability to generalize.
