\section{Background on Cellular Networks}
A basic understanding of the cellular network architecture will help with understanding the dataset used in this project. Cellular networks, be that 4G, 5G or any previous generation use electromagnetic waves to carry data. The access points for cellular networks are referred to as base stations or sometimes as cell towers. Base stations are what mobile devices such as your phone or laptop will connect to for its internet connection. As the main point of contact for mobile devices, we will focus our understanding of cellular networks solely on the interaction between mobile devices and base stations. A
