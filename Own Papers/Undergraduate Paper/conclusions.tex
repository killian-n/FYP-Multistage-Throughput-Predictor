\chapter{Conclusions}
The usefulness of multistage deep models in throughput prediction has been shown in this paper, with multistage models providing a noticable increase in relativistic measures of model performance such as percentage based errors. The multistage one architecture proposed in this paper proved to be the best of the 3 methods considered for throughput prediction in wireless cellular networks. The variability in cellular network channels still poses a challenge for throughput prediction algorithms with much room left for improvement. Now that the multistage approach has been proven viable for consideration in both non size-constricted and size-constricted deployments, the possibility exists to explore new multistage architectures to tackle the problem of wireless throughput prediction. More work still needs to be done on building and testing these models for deployment on mobile devices, as well optimisation of the sub-models used to construct a multistage approach.
